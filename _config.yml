user_description: Hi, I'm Ray, a rising junior at Amherst College. I'm looking for opportunities to diversify my skill set. I am interested in developing a wide range of skills in diverse fields that would complement each other in unexpected ways.  Currently, I am looking for opportunities that will enable me to learn and grow my skills in data  simulation, visualisation, and modelling.
